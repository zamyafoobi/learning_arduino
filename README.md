# LEARN ARDUINO

Arduino is a great entry point. I have been working with microprocessor systems since 1982. I have been working with adult and child students for the past 15 years.

There are other UNO systems that are not Arduino branded. If you don’t know enough to already have an opinion, then you are probably best served by buying the industry standard brand.

If you enjoy Arduino, and you want to go down one level towards the hardware, there’s some excellent series on starting with basically a naked (modern) 6502 processor. Like, no memory or clock or anything, and you add those as you go. It’s awesome.

If you enjoy it but want a microcontroller that’s more real world, STM32 is there for you.

If you enjoy Arduino, but want a “real computer”, Raspberry Pi is great.

You could probably get a good six months to a year of education out of an Arduino, especially if you get one of the kits that includes all the sensors. I use it myself for small projects or testing new hardware.
